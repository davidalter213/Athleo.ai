This project is an AI Fitness trainer that generates personalized workout & diet plans based on a voice conversation with an AI Agent using Vapi. The user will register for an account using clerk authentication (google, github, & email), and then have a voice conversation with the AI agent to discuss infomation such as weight, height, dietary conditions, fitness goals, ect. This information will then be stored in a convex database and fed into Gemini API to generate a custom plan for the user in real time.

Tech Stack:
- Next.Js, React, Tailwind & Shadcn UI
- Voice AI Assistant (Vapi)
- LLM Integration (Google Gemini API)
- Authentication & Authorization using Clerk
- Convex Database


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
